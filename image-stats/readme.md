# Cinema Image Statistics example

**NOTE:** Before you can run examples in this directory, you need to follow the instructions on the main repository `readme`.

To view the databases, type this command in the shell:

```
    cinema view --databases data/sphere.cdb --viewer view
```

This command will bring the database up in a different viewer:

```
    cinema view --databases data/sphere.cdb --viewer explorer
```

To run the example:

```
    cd scratch
    jupyter notebook show_image.ipynb
```
