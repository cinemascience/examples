# Cinema Training Examples

This is a set of examples to express the concepts behind Cinema, and provide a way to explore the algorithmic, viewing and processing possibilities that Cinema provides.


## Getting started

These examples require:

- A `python3` installation

To get started:

```
    git clone https://github.com/cinemascience/examples.git
    cd examples
```

Next, `cd` into the example you want to work with. Then create a local python environment for that example. This will install all of the necessary python modules, as well as the `cinema` command line tool:

```
    python3 -m venv exenv
    source exenv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install wheel
    pip3 install .
```
