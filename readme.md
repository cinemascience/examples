# Cinema Training Examples

This is a set of examples to express the concepts behind Cinema, and provide a way to explore the algorithmic, viewing and processing possibilities that Cinema provides.


## Getting started

These examples require:

- A `python3` installation

To get started:

```
    git clone https://github.com/cinemascience/examples.git
    cd examples
```

Next, `cd` into the example you want to work with. Then run `make example`. This will create the local environment for the example. 

```
    make example
```

Next, source the python environment for the local example:

```
    source exenv/bin/activate
```

Now, you will be set up to run the examples. Refer to the `readme.md` file in each subdirectory for specific instructions for that example.
